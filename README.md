# Reversible-Universal-Quadruple-Logic-Gates
Designing and Simulating the Reversible Universal Quadruple Logic Gates and Application. Here we have tried to use the quadruple valued logic gate to design an universal gate, TNOR gate which is reversible in nature and implement the basic gates using that reversible universal gate.


## Abstract:
Innovative technologies always provides an aid for the accomplishment of certain complex goals following an easier and organized approach. Ever since the inception of technological advancement, the minimization of power consumption has always been its prime objective. In the field of digital electronics reversible gates render this amelioration in a substantial way. With the presence of an equal number of inputs and outputs, no bit is lost, hence obtaining a reduction in power loss. In this paper, we have implemented an optical tree architecture (OTA) model of an optical reversible universal quadruple logic gate (ORUQLG). Realization of all the basic logic gates by using reversible universal quadruple gate along with block diagram and truth table is illustrated to prove its universality. The optical model of each gate using Savart plate and spatial light modulator (SLM) is explained to validate its functionality in a multi-valued logic system as well. Finally, simulation of all the circuits is done using python language to prove the authenticity of the developed circuits.
