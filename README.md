# Reversible-Universal-Quadruple-Logic-Gates
Designing and Simulating the Reversible Universal Quadruple Logic Gates and Application.
here we have tried to use the quadruple valued logic gate to design an universal gate, TNOR gate which is reversible in nature and implement the basic gates using that reversible universal gate.
This whole project has been communicated for a journal. I'll upload it soon after the journal gets published. 
cheers.
